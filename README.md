A use case diagram is used to represent the dynamic behavior of a system. 
It encapsulates the system's functionality by incorporating use cases, actors, and their relationships. 
It models the tasks, services, and functions required by a system/subsystem of an application. It depicts the high-level functionality of a system and also tells how the user handles a system.
