# UML Lab Experiment-1
Design a UML use case diagram for an online ticket booking system.
# Theory
A use case diagram is used to represent the dynamic behavior of a system. 
It encapsulates the system's functionality by incorporating use cases, actors, and their relationships. 
It models the tasks, services, and functions required by a system/subsystem of an application. It depicts the high-level functionality of a system and also tells how the user handles a system.
# Explanation
In the online ticket booking system, the user can browse the movies, select the movie, seat number and enter the details to book the ticket, whereas the admin can validate the payment details and update the new movie details. This relationship is interpreted in the form of UML use case diagram.

# UML Lab Experiment-2
Design a UML sequence Diagram for the Password Validation system.
# Theory
A sequence diagram consists of a group of objects that are represented by lifelines, and the messages that they exchange over time during the interaction. A sequence diagram shows the sequence of messages passed between objects. Sequence diagrams can also show the control structures between objects.
# Explanation
In password validation, the user enters will the user name and password in the login page, In the user data base the login credentials are validated. If the login credentials are correct, the login page will be redirected to Dashboard page. If the login details are incorrect, the database page will communicate to the login page saying "username or password is invalid" and user has to enter the valid credentials. This relationship is interpreted in the form of a UML sequence diagram.
